We're going to do some test-driven development of a Codewars kata, [Xmas Tree](https://www.codewars.com/kata/577c349edf78c178a1000108).

## Learning Outcomes

- Break down a problem into sub-problems
- Use a test-driven development process
- Write meaningful tests for a sub-problem

The `main` branch has no code - the coded demo will be on the `demo` branch.
